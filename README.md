# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project was created to provide a study guide for the bootcamp prework modules. It contains notes about Git, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The project should help to refresh the memories of bootcamp students looking back at the prework for some basic info that they might have forgotten. The project was also used as practice for me to create my very own website for the first time.
